              <h5 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>HOLDER OF THE TREATMENT</h5>
              <p>
                The holder of personal data is Lascod S.p.A., based in Sesto

              In addition to those freely provided by the user, the following
              data will be collected in connection with and in relation to

              <h5 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>COMMUNICATION OF DATA</h5>
              <p>
                Personal data may be disclosed to third parties to fulfill legal
                obligations, or to comply with orders from legitimate public
                authorities or to assert or defend a right in court.<br></br>
                If necessary in relation to particular services or products
                requested, it may be necessary that personal data must be
                communicated to third parties who could perform, as independent
                data controllers, functions strictly connected and instrumental
                to the provision of these services or to the provision of said
                products. Without the communication, necessary for the execution
                of the services, these services and products could not be
                provided.<br></br>
                With the consent of the interested parties, if required by law,
                and in any case subject to adequate information specifying the
                various purposes, personal data may possibly be disclosed to
                third parties, public and private, unrelated to Lascod SpA, who
                will treat them as autonomous owners of the treatment. Of the
                processing of personal data carried out by said third parties
                Lascod S.p.A. is in no way responsible.<br></br>
                Personal data will not be disclosed, unless the requested
                service requires publication of the name.<br></br>
                Again within the aforementioned purposes, the data could also be
                transferred outside the EU, in compliance with the adequacy
                decisions or in compliance with the appropriate or appropriate
                guarantees adopted by the EU Commission or in any case in
                compliance with what is otherwise provided for by the current
                provisions: to obtain a copy of these data or the place where
                they were made available, write to privacy@moldingmaterials.com
              </p>
              <h5 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>USER RIGHTS</h5>
              The GDPR articles 15-22 grant the interested party a series of
              rights that can be exercised towards the data controller
              concerning him/her.<br></br>
              In particular, he/she is granted the right of access to personal
              data, of rectification or cancellation of the same, of obtaining
              the limitation of the treatment or the opposition to the same and
              portability. The right of access to data can be exercised at
              reasonable intervals, in order to have correct and constant
              information on the treatment and to verify its lawfulness. The
              right to erasure concerns personal data processed in violation of
              the law or in the other cases provided for by art. 17 of the GDPR.
              <br></br>
              The interested party can obtain from the data controller the
              limitation of the processing for the period necessary for the
              verification of the personal data whose accuracy it disputes, or
              when the processing is illegal, preferring the limitation on the
              cancellation of the data, or if he needs to have available such
              data for the assessment, exercise or defense of a right in court,
              even if the owner no longer needs it for processing purposes, or
              for the period necessary to verify the possible prevalence of
              legitimate reasons of the owner with respect to the interested
              party and for whom the latter opposed the treatment. In case of
              limitation, personal data will be processed only with the consent
              of the interested party or for the assessment, exercise or defense
              of a right in court or to protect the rights of another natural or
              legal person or for reasons of significant public interest of the
              European Union or of a Member State. In any case, the interested
              party will be informed by the owner before he proceeds to revoke
              this limitation. For reasons connected to his situation, the
              interested party has the right to object to the processing of data
              necessary for the execution of a task of public interest or
              connected to the exercise of public powers with which the data
              controller is invested, or for the pursuit of the legitimate
              interest of the owner. The owner will refrain from further
              processing such data, unless it demonstrates the existence of
              binding legitimate reasons that prevail over those of the
              interested party. The latter may object to the processing at any
              time when personal data are processed for direct marketing
              purposes, including profiling. The right to object to the
              processing of data for marketing purposes carried out with
              automated contact methods extends to traditional ones, without
              prejudice to the possibility of the interested party to exercise
              this right in whole or in part, that is, by opposing, for example,
              the only sending promotional communications made through automated
              tools. The interested party has the right to data portability (the
              possibility of receiving the data provided and possibly
              transmitting it to another data controller) in cases where it is
              allowed by the GDPR (art. 20).<br></br>
              The interested party has the right not to be subjected to a
              decision based exclusively on automated processing, including
              profiling. Exceptionally, this type of treatment is possible if
              authorized by Union or Member State law to which the owner is
              subject, or if permitted by him or if necessary for contractual
              purposes. In the last two cases, the interested party still has
              the right to obtain human intervention from the owner, to express
              his opinion and to contest the decision. With the consent of the
              interested party and appropriate measures to protect rights,
              freedoms and legitimate interests, this type of treatment can also
              concern particular personal data. For the exercise of these
              rights, the interested party can contact the contacts indicated
              above.
